# Combating Smells Extract Method 
 
##Learning Competencies 

* Refactor poorly formatted code.
* Organize code for consistency and readability.
* Research best practices and integrate them into code.

##Summary 

 *Code smells are signals that portions of code could be improved*. All code has smells, choosing which smells to address and which to ignore is a key survival skill.

Identifying smelly code is not enough. You then must know which  refactoring(s) are useful to clean up a given smell.
